## Functions
Create notes, search, save, update, delete and mark your note as favourite.
The Quire product itself is also available in dark mode.   



## The process
The project was set up as if it was in for a company on the market . The project had its own project owner and a CTO and a scrum methodology was used to develop the note-book. The group members daily scrums, weekly meetings with the project owner and weekly code reviews with the CTO. Feel free to look at our scrum board on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/88BX5SUp/team-template)
